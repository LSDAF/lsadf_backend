/**
 * A MapStruct mapper interface for converting {@link GameSaveEntity} objects into {@link GameSave}
 * domain models.
 *
 * <p>This mapper performs the transformation of persistence-layer entities into domain models used
 * in the application layer. It extends the {@link EntityModelMapper} interface, inheriting the
 * mapping contract to handle entity-to-model conversions.
 *
 * <p>Design Considerations: - Utilizes MapStruct for automatic implementation generation. - Depends
 * on additional mappers {@link CharacteristicsEntityMapper}, {@link StageEntityMapper}, and {@link
 * CurrencyEntityMapper} to handle mappings of nested or composite objects within a {@link
 * GameSaveEntity} object.
 *
 * <p>Responsibilities: - Converts the attributes of a {@link GameSaveEntity} to its corresponding
 * {@link GameSave} representation. - Ensures seamless and accurate mapping for all relevant fields,
 * promoting clean separation between persistence and domain layers. - Handles nested or composite
 * objects by delegating to their respective mappers.
