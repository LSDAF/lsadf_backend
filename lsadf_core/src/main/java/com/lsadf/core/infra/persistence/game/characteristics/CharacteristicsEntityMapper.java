/**
 * Maps a {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to a {@link Characteristics} model. This class implements
 * the {@link EntityModelMapper} interface to convert persistent entities used within the data layer
 * into domain models that are utilized in the business or application logic layer.
 *
 * <p>The mapping process involves transferring specific attributes such as attack, critical chance,
 * critical damage, health, and resistance from the entity representation into the corresponding
 * fields within the model representation.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to be used in scenarios where characteristics information needs to be
 * transferred from the persistence layer to the application layer, ensuring data consistency and
 * proper encapsulation.
 *
 * <p>Thread Safety: This implementation is thread-safe as it performs no mutation of shared state.
