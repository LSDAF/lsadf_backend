/**
 * UserToUserRepresentationMapper is a MapStruct-based mapper interface designed to handle the
 * transformation of {@link User} domain objects into {@link UserRepresentation} objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends the {@code Mapper} interface, providing type-safe and reusable mapping
 * functionality for converting between the {@code User} and {@code UserRepresentation} models.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of this mapper is generated at runtime by MapStruct, eliminating the need
 * for manual mapping code and ensuring consistency across the application. The generated instance
 * of this mapper can be accessed as a singleton through the static {@link #INSTANCE} field.
 *
 * <p>Key features: - Ignores the mapping of the {@code id} and {@code createdTimestamp} fields in
 * the generated output to prevent unintentional overwrites during the transformation process. -
 * Facilitates seamless conversion between domain and representation models in service or controller
 * layers.
 *
 * <p>Typical scenarios for using this mapper might include: - Preparing a {@code
 * UserRepresentation} object to be sent as a response in API layers. - Converting domain entities
 * to external representation formats in multi-service communication
