/**
 * An interface representing a generic, serializable entity.
 *
 * <p>This interface is typically implemented by classes representing domain entities that are
 * intended to be stored in a persistent storage. It extends the {@link Serializable} interface to
 * ensure that implementing classes can be serialized, which is often required for persistence
 * operations or distributed communication.
 *
 * <p>Classes implementing this interface are expected to define their own unique identifier and any
 * additional attributes or behaviors required for their domain-specific functionality.
 *
 * <p>This serves as a marker interface, outlining a standard contract for entities without
 * enforcing specific method implementations.
