/**
 * Interface for mapping {@link CurrencyRequest} objects to {@link Currency} model objects. This
 * mapper uses the MapStruct library to generate implementation code at compile time. It extends
 * {@link RequestModelMapper} to inherit generic mapping capabilities.
 *
 * <p>The primary purpose of this mapper is to handle conversions between the request layer
 * representation of currency-related data and the application's internal domain representation.
 *
 * <p>Implementing Classes: - Uses MapStruct-generated implementation via {@link
 * org.mapstruct.factory.Mappers}.
 *
 * <p>Features: - Ensures consistency between JSON-based input requests and internal model objects.
