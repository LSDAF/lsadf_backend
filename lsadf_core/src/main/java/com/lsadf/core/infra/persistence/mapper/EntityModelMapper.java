/**
 * A functional interface representing a mapper that transforms an entity of type {@code E} into a
 * model of type {@code M}.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link ModelMapper} and specializes it for use with entity-to-model
 * mapping, where the input type is an implementation of {@link Entity} and the output type is an
 * implementation of {@link Model}. It is primarily intended for converting persistence-layer
 * entities into domain models used in the application layer, promoting modularity and separation of
 * concerns.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are responsible for defining the mapping logic specific to
 * their domain, allowing for consistent and reusable transformation between entities and models.
 *
 * <p>Design Considerations: - This interface is a {@link FunctionalInterface}, meaning it can be
 * implemented using a lambda expression or method reference. - The {@link #map(Entity)} method
 * should ensure that all relevant fields from the entity are correctly and completely transferred
 * to the model. - Implementations should handle any necessary validation of the input or
 * transformations required to align with business rules.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the entity to be mapped (must extend {@link Entity})
 * @param <M> the type of the model to be produced (must extend {@link Model})
