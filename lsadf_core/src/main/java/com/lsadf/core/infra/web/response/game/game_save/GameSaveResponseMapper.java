/**
 * Mapper interface for converting {@link GameSave} domain model objects into {@link
 * GameSaveResponse} objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface is used to encapsulate the mapping logic required for translating the internal
 * representations of game save data into external response formats that are exposed via APIs.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of this mapper is automatically generated at runtime by the MapStruct
 * library, ensuring accurate and efficient field mapping between the {@link GameSave} and {@link
 * GameSaveResponse} types. The mapper utilizes additional mappers for nested conversions, such as
 * {@link CharacteristicsResponseMapper}, {@link CurrencyResponseMapper}, and {@link
 * StageResponseMapper}.
 *
 * <p>The generated implementation of this mapper is accessible as a singleton instance, {@code
 * INSTANCE}.
