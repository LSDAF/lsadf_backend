 * A mapper interface for transforming {@link Item} objects into their corresponding {@link
 * ItemResponse} representations. This interface extends the generic {@code ModelResponseMapper} to
 * provide specific mapping functionality between the domain model {@link Item} and its response
 * counterpart {@link ItemResponse}.
 *
 * <p>The intended use of this mapper is to encapsulate the logic required for converting the
 * internal representation of an {@link Item} into a format suitable for external APIs or other
 * external representations. By leveraging MapStruct annotations and features, the implementation
 * can be generated at compile time, ensuring efficiency and reducing manual mapping efforts.
 *
 * <p>The {@link ItemResponseMapper#INSTANCE} field serves as the singleton instance for accessing
 * the generated implementation of this interface.
