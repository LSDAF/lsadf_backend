/**
 * A mapper implementation responsible for converting {@link UserCreationRequest} objects into their
 * corresponding {@link User} model representations. This class implements the {@link
 * RequestModelMapper} interface to define the specific mapping logic required for creating a {@link
 * User} instance based on the incoming request data.
 *
 * <p>The mapping process includes transferring properties such as first name, last name, username,
 * user roles, and whether the email is verified or enabled. Additionally, it sets the user creation
 * timestamp to the current date.
 *
 * <p>The {@code mapToModel} method is the core function that performs the mapping operation,
 * ensuring all necessary attributes are appropriately populated in the {@link User} model.
