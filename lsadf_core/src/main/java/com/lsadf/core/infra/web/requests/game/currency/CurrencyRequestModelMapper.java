 * A mapper implementation for transforming a {@link CurrencyRequest} object into its corresponding

 * of {@link Currency}, ensuring alignment between the input request and the target domain model.
 *
 * <p>Implements the {@link RequestModelMapper} interface with {@link CurrencyRequest} as the
 * request type and {@link Currency} as the target model type.
