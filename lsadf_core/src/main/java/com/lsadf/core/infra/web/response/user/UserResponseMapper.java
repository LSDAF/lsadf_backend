/**
 * Interface representing a mapper for converting a User domain model to its corresponding
 * UserResponse Data Transfer Object (DTO).
 *
 * <p>This interface extends the {@link ModelResponseMapper} interface, which provides a generic
 * definition for mapping domain models to their associated response objects. The UserResponseMapper
 * serves as a concrete mapper specifically designed for handling the mapping logic from {@code
 * User} to {@code UserResponse}.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of this mapper is automatically generated at runtime by the MapStruct
 * library. The generated implementation is responsible for mapping all relevant fields between the
 * User and UserResponse objects and is accessible as a static instance variable {@code INSTANCE}.
 *
 * <p>The map method defined by this interface ensures that a given User domain model is transformed
 * into a corresponding UserResponse DTO, which conforms to the structure required for API responses
 * or other external representations.
