/**
 * An abstract base class for persistent entities that standardizes common attributes and behavior
 * such as unique identifiers, creation timestamps, and update timestamps. This class implements the
 * {@link Entity} interface, ensuring each entity has a unique identifier.
 *
 * <p>The class leverages JPA annotations to define persistence-level details, such as primary keys
 * and columns. It also provides lifecycle callback methods to handle operations at entity creation
 * and update events.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code id}: The unique identifier for the entity, generated automatically if not provided.
 *   <li>{@code createdAt}: The timestamp indicating when the entity was created. Automatically set
 *       during entity creation.
 *   <li>{@code updatedAt}: The timestamp indicating when the entity was last updated. Updated
 *       automatically during modification.
 * </ul>
 *
 * To use this class, extend it with specific entity implementations while defining additional
 * fields and behavior as needed.
 *
 * <p>The class relies on {@code Lombok} for boilerplate code reduction, including annotations like
 * {@code @Getter}, {@code @Setter}, {@code @ToString}, {@code @EqualsAndHashCode}, and
 * {@code @SuperBuilder}.
 *
 * <p>This class is annotated with {@code @MappedSuperclass}, indicating that it serves as a
 * superclass for JPA entities without being directly mapped to a database table.
