/**
 * Maps {@link CharacteristicsRequest} objects to {@link Characteristics} domain models. This class
 * serves as a concrete implementation of the {@link RequestModelMapper} interface, transforming
 * request data into the application's internal representation.
 *
 * <p>The mapping logic extracts the following properties from the {@code CharacteristicsRequest}
 * object and constructs a {@code Characteristics} object: - Attack level - Critical chance level -
 * Critical damage level - Health level - Resistance level
 *
 * <p>Implements the {@code mapToModel} method to define the specific transformation logic. This
 * ensures that input values from the request are accurately translated into the corresponding
 * fields of the domain model.
