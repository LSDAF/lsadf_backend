/**
 * A mapper interface responsible for converting {@link CurrencyEntity} objects into {@link
 * Currency} objects and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link EntityModelMapper}, inheriting the contract to map entities to
 * models. It provides an implementation specific to converting currency-related persistence-layer
 * entities into domain models used in the application layer.
 *
 * <p>This mapper is implemented using MapStruct, allowing for automatic generation of the
 * implementation at build time.
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities: - Facilitates transforming {@link CurrencyEntity} objects into {@link
 * Currency} domain models. - Promotes separation of concerns by abstracting the conversion logic
 * out of business logic layers.
 *
 * <p>Singleton instance {@code INSTANCE} is provided for use in applications. MapStruct generates
 * the implementation during compilation, ensuring a consistent and performant mapping process.
