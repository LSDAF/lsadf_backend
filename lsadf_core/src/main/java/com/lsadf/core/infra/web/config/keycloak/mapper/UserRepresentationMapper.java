/**
 * UserRepresentationMapper is an interface that defines the mapping behavior for converting {@link
 * UserRepresentation} objects to {@link User} objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends the {@link ModelMapper} interface, specializing its type parameters for
 * mapping from UserRepresentation to User. It provides a centralized and reusable mapping logic
 * between these specific types.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of this interface is generated at runtime by the {@link Mappers} utility,
 * ensuring type safety and reducing the need for boilerplate mapping code.
 *
 * <p>Usage of this interface typically involves injecting the generated instance and calling the
 * defined {@link #map(UserRepresentation)} method for direct model conversion.
 *
 * <p>Example scenarios where this mapper might be used include: - Converting a UserRepresentation
 * object fetched from an external system (e.g., Keycloak) into a User object used within the
 * application domain. - Ensuring consistency and standardization in mapping logic across the
 * application.
 *
 * <p>Note: The instance of this mapper is initialized as a singleton using {@link
 * Mappers#getMapper(Class)} for efficient memory use and centralized mapping logic.
