/**
 * A specialized functional interface for mapping objects of a domain model type {@code M} to
 * corresponding response objects of type {@code R}.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends the {@link Mapper} interface, providing additional semantic context
 * specific to mapping domain models to API response objects or other externally exposed
 * representations. The interface is particularly useful for defining a consistent mapping strategy
 * across various domain models and their respective response types.
 *
 * <p>It enforces a single abstract method {@code map}, making it compatible with lambda expressions
 * and method references for lightweight and reusable mapping definitions. Developers can implement
 * this interface to define the transformation logic between specific domain model classes and their
 * corresponding response representations.
 *
 * @param <M> the type of the domain model object to be mapped, which must extend the {@link Model}
 *     interface
 * @param <R> the type of the response object resulting from the mapping, which must extend the
 *     {@link Response} interface
