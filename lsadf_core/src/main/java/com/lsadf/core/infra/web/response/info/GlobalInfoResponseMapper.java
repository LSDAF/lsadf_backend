/**
 * Mapper interface for converting {@link GlobalInfo} model objects into {@link GlobalInfoResponse}
 * representation objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link ModelResponseMapper} to define the mapping logic specific to
 * transforming {@code GlobalInfo} domain model objects into their API response format, {@code
 * GlobalInfoResponse}. It enables consistent and reusable mapping strategies using the MapStruct
 * library.
 *
 * <p>The primary use case for this interface is to facilitate the mapping of backend data
 * structures to API responses in a way that supports immutability and serialization requirements.
 *
 * <p>The {@code GlobalInfoResponseMapper} provides a singleton instance via the {@code INSTANCE}
 * field, which is automatically generated and initialized by MapStruct.
 *
 * <p>Key features include: - Supports automatic mapping of fields between {@code GlobalInfo} and
 * {@code GlobalInfoResponse}, provided their names and types are compatible. - Enables
 * extensibility via MapStruct annotations for custom mapping configurations or advanced use cases.
 *
 * <p>This interface is utilized in the context of controller implementations to convert data
 * retrieved from services into format-ready response objects that comply with API contracts.
 *
 * <p>Example usage context includes scenarios where controllers (such as {@code
 * AdminGlobalInfoControllerImpl}) need a lightweight and efficient conversion of domain objects
 * into API responses.
