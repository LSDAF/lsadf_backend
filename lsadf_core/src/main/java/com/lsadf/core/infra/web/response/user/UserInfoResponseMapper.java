/**
 * This interface defines a mapper to transform {@link UserInfo} model instances into {@link
 * UserInfoResponse} objects.
 *
 * <p>It extends {@link ModelResponseMapper} to inherit the general mapping contract between domain
 * model and response types, specifically specializing in mapping {@link UserInfo} to {@link
 * UserInfoResponse}.
 *
 * <p>The implementation relies on the MapStruct library to generate the mapping logic at compile
 * time. The instance {@code INSTANCE} is provided for convenient access to the generated
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>Key functionality includes translating the attributes of {@link UserInfo}, such as the user's
 * name, email, verification status, and roles, into the corresponding fields of {@link
 * UserInfoResponse}.
 *
 * <p>Example usage scenarios where this is helpful: - Converting backend domain objects into
 * user-facing API responses. - Ensuring data consistency and transformation logic is centralized
 * and reusable.
 *
 * <p>This mapper supports immutability by working with immutable data transfer objects ({@code
 * record} types) for both the input model and the output response.
