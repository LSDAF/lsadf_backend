/**
 * Maps {@link CharacteristicsEntity} objects to {@link Characteristics} domain models.
 *
 * <p>This interface serves as a concrete implementation of the {@link EntityModelMapper} interface,
 * transforming persistence-layer entities into domain models used in the application layer.
 *
 * <p>The mapping process includes the following transformation details: - Maps the {@code attack}
 * attribute from {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to {@link Characteristics}. - Maps the {@code
 * critChance} attribute from {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to {@link Characteristics}. - Maps the
 * {@code critDamage} attribute from {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to {@link Characteristics}. -
 * Maps the {@code health} attribute from {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to {@link Characteristics}.
 * - Maps the {@code resistance} attribute from {@link CharacteristicsEntity} to {@link
 * Characteristics}.
 *
 * <p>Design notes: - Uses MapStruct for the mapper implementation. - Ensures type correctness and
 * proper handling of null or invalid values during the mapping process. - Promotes reusability and
 * decoupling between persistence and application layers.
