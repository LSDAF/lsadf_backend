/**
 * The {@code StageRequestMapper} interface is a MapStruct mapper responsible for converting {@link
 * StageRequest} objects into {@link Stage} objects.
 *
 * <p>This mapper facilitates the transformation of client-facing request payloads into domain model
 * objects, adhering to the contract defined by the {@link RequestModelMapper} interface.
 *
 * <p>Using MapStruct's automatic mapping capabilities, this interface simplifies the mapping logic,
 * removing the need for manual transformation of properties between {@code StageRequest} and {@code
 * Stage}.
 *
 * <p>Key features: - Maps all fields between {@code StageRequest} and {@code Stage} directly,
 * provided they share compatible types. - Uses the {@link Mappers#getMapper(Class)} method to
 * automatically provide an implementation of this interface.
 *
 * <p>See {@link StageRequest} for details on the request-layer object. See {@link Stage} for
 * details on the domain-layer model.
