/**
 * This interface defines a mapper for converting {@link AdditionalItemStatEntity} entities into
 * {@link ItemStat} domain models. It provides a mechanism for mapping persistence-layer entities to
 * application-layer models, supporting modularity and separation of concerns.
 *
 * <p>It extends the {@link EntityModelMapper} interface, which is a functional interface designed
 * for general-purpose entity-to-model transformations, and specializes it for the mapping between
 * `AdditionalItemStatEntity` and `ItemStat`.
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities of the mapper: - Transform an {@code AdditionalItemStatEntity} into an
 * {@code ItemStat} model while preserving all relevant data fields, ensuring consistency between
 * the database and application layers. - Promote code reusability by providing a static mapper
 * instance accessible via the {@code INSTANCE} field for straightforward integration with other
 * application components.
