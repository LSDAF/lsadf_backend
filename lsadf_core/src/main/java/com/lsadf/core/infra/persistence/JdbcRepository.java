/**
 * A repository interface extending {@link Repository} for managing entities of type {@link Entity}
 * and uniquely identified by {@link UUID}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code JdbcRepository} interface serves as a Data Access Layer abstraction for interacting
 * with persistent storage, specifically for entities conforming to the {@link Entity} contract. By
 * extending {@link Repository}, this interface supports the default Spring Data repository
 * functionality, like CRUD operations and custom query methods.
 *
 * <p>Key Characteristics: - The entities managed by this repository must implement the {@link
 * Entity} interface. - Each entity is uniquely identified by a {@link UUID}.
