 * Represents a game save creation request that encapsulates multiple components of a game save,

 * <p>This interface extends the {@link Request} interface to ensure compatibility with request
 * handling mechanisms. Implementations of this interface provide the necessary details for creating
 * or managing game save records, with methods to retrieve specific parts of the game save data.
 *
 * <p>Methods: - {@code getMetadataRequest}: Obtains the metadata details such as user information
 * and identifiers. - {@code getCharacteristicsRequest}: Retrieves the user's in-game
 * characteristics, including attributes like attack, health, and resistance. - {@code
 * getCurrencyRequest}: Provides information about the user's in-game currencies, such as gold and
 * diamonds. - {@code getStageRequest}: Supplies data about the user's progress in terms of current
 * and maximum stage levels.
