/**
 * A functional interface for mapping an input object of type {@code I} to an output object of type
 * {@code O}.
 *
 * <p>The Mapper interface allows developers to define custom mapping logic to convert an input to a
 * desired output format. It serves as a foundational contract for defining mapping operations in
 * various contexts, such as transforming domain models, DTOs, or API response objects.
 *
 * <p>The use of the {@link FunctionalInterface} annotation ensures that this interface can be used
 * as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference, providing concise and
 * reusable mapping functionality across different layers of an application.
 *
 * @param <I> the type of the input object to be mapped
 * @param <O> the type of the output object resulting from the mapping
